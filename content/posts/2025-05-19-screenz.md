My most recent personal project, **Screenz**, started out as a brief study of WebRTC technology
but, once I found myself using it for practical purposes, I decided to share it.  

You can access it at [https://screenz.agst.dev](https://screenz.agst.dev).  
You can also view its source code at [https://github.com/agstrc/screenz](https://github.com/agstrc/screenz).

## What is Screenz?

Screenz is a straightforward web tool designed for one core purpose: sharing your screen
with someone else easily and quickly. Forget complex installations or account setups. With
Screenz, you can start broadcasting your screen with just a couple of clicks.

The process is simple:

1. Click "Start Stream".
2. Share the unique "Streamer Code" provided with anyone you want to view your screen.
3. They enter the code on the Screenz website and click "Watch Stream" to connect directly
   to your broadcast.

It's built to be a direct, no-fuss solution, focusing on providing a secure connection with
minimal delay between what you're doing and what your viewers see. The goal is truly
effortless screen sharing.

## WebRTC

At the heart of Screenz is **WebRTC**â€”a powerful technology that enables real-time,
peer-to-peer communication directly between browsers. WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication)
is not just a single protocol, but rather a collection of standards and APIs that allow
audio, video, and data to flow securely and efficiently between users, without the need
for intermediary servers.

What makes WebRTC especially compelling for screen sharing is its ability to establish
direct connections between participants. This minimizes latency and maximizes privacy,
since your screen data doesn't pass through a central server. Instead, browsers negotiate
a connection using a process called **signaling**, and then exchange information using
protocols like ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment), STUN (Session Traversal
Utilities for NAT), and DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) for encryption.

**Signaling** is the initial process where peers exchange information (such as network
details and media capabilities) required to set up the peer-to-peer connection. This is
typically done through a lightweight server that simply relays these setup messages
between users. Importantly, once the connection is established, all actual screen data
flows directly between browsers, bypassing the server entirely.

Because WebRTC is peer-to-peer, hosting Screenz was straightforward: my server only needs
to handle the signaling phase, which is a minimal and transient load compared to relaying
video streams. This architecture makes it easy and cost-effective to provide the service,
since the server is not a bottleneck for bandwidth or performance.

All major browsers support the WebRTC API, making it possible to build robust,
cross-platform applications like Screenz. While the underlying technology involves a
complex interplay of networking and multimedia protocols, the end result is a seamless
experience for users: fast, secure, and reliable screen sharing with just a few clicks.

If you're interested in diving deeper into how WebRTC works, I highly recommend

technical overview.
